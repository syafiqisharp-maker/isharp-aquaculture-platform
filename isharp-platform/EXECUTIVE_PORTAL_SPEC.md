## 6. Sprint Log: Phase 2 & Phase 3 Completed (2026-10-04)

### Phase 2 Accomplishments (Delivered):
1. **Grid Component Architecture (`PondGridMap.js`):**
   - 9 Modules (`Module 01` to `Module 09`) with 2 Rows each (`01.01` to `09.18`) and 12 Ponds per row = **216 Ponds rendered**.
   - Dual top-left navigation buttons on DBMS view: `[ ← Back to Portal ]` and `[ 🗺️ Executive Map ]` for fast direct switching.
   - Clean, uncluttered module headers (`Module 01`, `Module 02`, etc.) without redundant badge clutter.
2. **Farm-Wide Data Integration Across All 9 Modules:**
   - Implemented `PondRepository.getActiveCycles()` querying `stocking_records?pond_status=neq.CLOSE&limit=1000`.
   - Surfaces all 291 active farm cycles (137 Production, 71 Idle, 18 Reservoir, 8 Maintenance) across all 9 modules.
   - Robust coordinate fallback derivation via `derivePondCode(pond_index)` (e.g. `2020307.41` $\rightarrow$ `02.03.07`).
3. **Biosecurity & Pathology Engine:**
   - Evaluates laboratory records from `pond_issues`:
     - 🔴 **Red Alert**: Active positive PCR / clinical pathogen flag (`issue_flag = 'RED'` or EHP/EMS/WSSV positive).
     - 🟡 **Yellow Warning**: Elevated risk / suspicious pathology (`issue_flag = 'YELLOW'`).
     - 🟢 **Green (Clean Active)**: In production with clean lab results (`issue_flag = 'GREEN'` or no issues).
     - ⚪ / 🔵 **Neutral / Muted Slate**: Idle, maintenance, or reservoir ponds.
4. **Slide-Out Detail Drawer:**
   - Clicking any pond smoothly slides out full telemetry snapshot, Stocking Date, Latest ABW (g), Biomass (kg), Survival Rate (%), recent Lab issues, and a direct `[ ⚙️ Open in DBMS View ]` button.
   - Clean tile hover with subtle elevation (`scale(1.03)`); floating tooltip eliminated to prevent screen clutter.
5. **Interactive Filters & Cache:**
   - Filter by Species (`All`, `VAN`, `MON`).
   - Filter by Biosecurity (`All`, `🔴 Red Alert`, `🟡 Warning`, `🟢 Clean`, `⚪ Idle`).
   - Filter by Culture Stage: `All`, `Early (<30 DOC)`, `Mid (30–70 DOC)`, `Finishing (>70 DOC)`.
   - 5-minute smart in-memory session cache (`sessionStorage`) with one-click `[ 🔄 Refresh ]` button.

### Phase 3 Accomplishments (Delivered):
1. **Executive Production & Biomass Intelligence (`ExecutiveBiomassView.js`):**
   - **Sleek Pastel Design Language:** Understated Nordic / Quiet Luxury theme featuring soft Celadon Sage (`#ECFDF5`), Warm Apricot (`#FFF7ED`), Pale Honey (`#FEFCE8`), and Glacier Blue (`#F0F9FF`).
   - **6-Tile Executive KPI Strip:** Optimum Ready (Count & Tons), Minimum Ready (Count & Tons), 14-Day Forward Intake Forecast (+Tons), Slow Growth Watch (DOC 70+), Forced & Alert (Stunted / PCR Positive), and Live Standing Crop Biomass (Tons & Active Ponds).
   - **Interactive Harvest Readiness Pipeline & Action Gate:** Tabular list with segmented tabs (`All Ready`, `Optimum`, `Minimum`, `Forced / Alert`, `14d Forecast`), live biosecurity markers, and 1-click action triggers (`Schedule Plant`, `Partial Thinning`, `Terminate Pond`).
   - **12-Month Moving Minimalist Canvas Chart:** Soft sky-pastel column bars (`#BAE6FD`) paired with a Pine Emerald bezier revenue line and open data points. Handled initial hidden tab rendering with `ResizeObserver` on the parent container to prevent 0x0 canvas collapse.
   - **Species-Differentiated Realized Pricing:** Segregated realized price per kg between Vannamei (`VAN RM/kg`, farm avg RM 19.86/kg) and Monodon (`MON RM/kg`, farm avg RM 29.56/kg) derived from real transaction revenue and harvested weight.
   - **Purge of Synthetic Assumptions:** Eliminated arbitrary 25% margin assumptions across domain models, ledger, and CSV. All financial metrics strictly originate from recorded transactions.
   - **Commercial Quality & Packout Grading:** Visual progress bars displaying Prime Good Grade (69.5%), 2nd Grade (18.8%), Small (10.3%), and Below/Rejects (1.4%).
   - **Top Off-Takers Breakdown:** Commercial volume share, realized price per kg, and species badges (`VAN` / `MON`) for BAB Processing Plant, SBH Marine, and CS Fishery.
   - **12-Month Performance Ledger Table:** Complete historical table with species-separated price columns (`VAN RM/kg`, `MON RM/kg`) and 1-click `[ 📥 Export CSV ]`.
2. **Database Sync Deduplication (`database_migration/sync_weekly_access.ps1`):**
   - Transitioned harvest and sampling table inserts into upsert/merge logic keyed on composite natural keys (`harv_date` + `pond_index` + `harv_type`, and `sampling_date` + `pond_index`), eliminating duplicate historical records on re-runs.
3. **Build Verification:**
   - Production Vite build compiled cleanly with zero errors.
